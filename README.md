Predictions on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset

The Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 
For this report, a machine learning model was developed to predict if the barbell lifts were performed correctly. The model and the important choices made for its development are explained on the report.

The data for this project comes from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har
