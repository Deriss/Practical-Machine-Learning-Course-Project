# Practical Machine Learning Course Project
Predictions on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset

The Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 
For this report, a machine learning model was developed to predict if the barbell lifts were performed correctly. The model and the important choices made for its development are explained on the report.

This project is part of the Practical Machine Learning MOOC offered by Johns Hopkins University as part of the Data Science Specialization on Coursera.
The data for this project comes from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har
